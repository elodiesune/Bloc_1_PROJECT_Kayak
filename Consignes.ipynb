    "To help you achieve this project, here are a few tips that should help you\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get weather data with an API \n",
    "\n",
    "*   Use https://nominatim.org/ to get the gps coordinates of all the cities (no subscription required) Documentation : https://nominatim.org/release-docs/develop/api/Search/\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Use https://openweathermap.org/appid (you have to subscribe to get a free apikey) and https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api to get some information about the weather for the 35 cities and put it in a DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Determine the list of cities where the weather will be the nicest within the next 7 days For example, you can use the values of daily.pop and daily.rain to compute the expected volume of rain within the next 7 days... But it's only an example, actually you can have different opinions on a what a nice weather would be like üòé Maybe the most important criterion for you is the temperature or humidity, so feel free to change the rules !\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Save all the results in a `.csv` file, you will use it later üòâ You can save all the informations that seem important to you ! Don't forget to save the name of the cities, and also to create a column containing a unique identifier (id) of each city (this is important for what's next in the project)\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Use plotly to display the best destinations on a map\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scrape Booking.com \n",
    "\n",
    "Since BookingHoldings doesn't have aggregated databases, it will be much faster to scrape data directly from booking.com \n",
    "\n",
    "You can scrap as many information asyou want, but we suggest that you get at least:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   hotel name,\n",
    "*   Url to its booking.com page,\n",
    "*   Its coordinates: latitude and longitude\n",
    "*   Score given by the website users\n",
    "*   Text description of the hotel\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create your data lake using S3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you managed to build your dataset, you should store into S3 as a csv file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ETL \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you uploaded your data onto S3, it will be better for the next data analysis team to extract clean data directly from a Data Warehouse. Therefore, create a SQL Database using AWS RDS, extract your data from S3 and store it in your newly created DB. "
